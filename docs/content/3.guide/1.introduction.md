This plugin provide a way to cache **HTTP requests** in order to **improve performance**. It's get inspired by varnish cache which is a popular caching solution.

The cache content is stored by a **provider**, which can be either an in-memory provider, a redis connection, a file system, or any other custom provider.
You can set a **strategy** to tell what to cache and how much time responses should be cached. The cache will be invalidated when the related Content-Type is updated, so you **never have to worry about stale data**.

In addition, you can interact with the plugin through the admin panel, api admin routes or programmatically using internal services.
